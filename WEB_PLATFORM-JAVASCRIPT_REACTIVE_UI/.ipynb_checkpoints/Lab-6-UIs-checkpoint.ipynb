    "# Lab 6: The Web Browser as a Plaform\n",
    "*Due 5 PM, Thursday March 20, 2020*\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is about programming the web browser to build front-end user interfaces (UIs) for the kinds of back-end services we've designed earlier in class. Learning about programming the browser is important because the same set of technologies, languages, and frameworks form the basis for programming many mobile and desktop applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two big ideas in today's lecture and in this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imperative vs. Declarative Approaches\n",
    "* Reactive Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll first examine the traditional imperative approach to programming UIs. In doing so, we'll try to uncover the challenges this approach presents. Next, we'll look at a _reactive_, _declarative_ approach, specifically a framework called React originally developed by Facebook. You won't become a master in one lab. That will take longer. But you will understand the core principles of programming reactively, enough to start building your own apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Imperative Approach: Direct Manipulation of the DOM\n",
    "\n",
    "The following JavaScript extract is illustrative of how browsers were programmed for at least a decade. There were dozens of frameworks and libraries. They all followed some variation of the imperative theme shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first create an empty HTML file called `index.html` with the following content:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "  <title>My Counter App </title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    <h2>Counter</h2>\n",
    "    <div id=\"app\"/>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up the saved html file in your browser. It should show a page with a single `<h2>` element that says \"Counter\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Next open up the browser development console (Command-Shift-I or Control-Shift-I), select the \"Console\" tab and paste in the following JavaScript code. You might want to do this one line at a time to examine what each statement is doing. At the end you should see an unorderded (`<ul>`) list with two items in it. That's it! Your first JavaScript code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code manipulates the DOM directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get a reference to the empty <div id=\"app\"/> element\n",
    "app = document.getElementById(\"app\")\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a <ul> element\n",
    "ul = document.createElement(\"ul\")\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add the <ul> element to the <div id=\"app\"/> element\n",
    "app.appendChild(ul)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add a <li> list item to the <ul>\n",
    "li = document.createElement(\"li\")\n",
    "\n",
    "// Set the text of the list item\n",
    "li.innerHTML = \"one\"\n",
    "\n",
    "// append the list item to the <ul>\n",
    "// This should show the li on screen\n",
    "ul.appendChild(li)\n",
    "\n",
    "// add a second list element\n",
    "li = document.createElement(\"li\")\n",
    "li.innerHTML = \"two\"\n",
    "ul.appendChild(li)\n",
    "\n",
    "// change the text of if the last list element\n",
    "li.innerHTML = \"new\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll add a button that increments a counter shown on screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "b = document.createElement(\"button\")\n",
    "b.innerHTML = \"Increment\"\n",
    "app.appendChild(b)\n",
    "\n",
    "counterText = document.createElement(\"p\")\n",
    "counterText.innerHTML = \"0\"\n",
    "\n",
    "app.appendChild(counterText)\n",
    "\n",
    "let counter = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "const incrementHandler = (event) => {\n",
    "    counter = counter + 1\n",
    "    console.log(counter)\n",
    "    counterText.innerHTML = counter.toString()\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "b.addEventListener(\"click\", incrementHandler)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For practice, add a button called \"Decrement\", that reduces the value of the counter when clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with this tiny model, we begin to see some of the limitations of the imperative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principally, he application logic (what happens when a user clicks on a button), the backend data manipulation logic (e.g., increment the counter), and the\n",
    "application state (e.g., the counter) are all intermingled together. Change one part of the application, say by adding some more state and some more user interactions), and you have to consider the impact of the change all over the application. When a system has hundreds of interacting components, it becomes ever more difficult to reason about the program and to grow and extend the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Declarative Programming With React\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider an alternative approach that addresses some of the main limitations of the imperative model. The hallmarks of the declarative, reactive approach we'll consider here are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complete separation of data layer from application logic and presentation.\n",
    "* Declarative presentation of the UI. Instead of commanding the UI to insert UI elements as in the counter example above, *declare* the structure of the UI and have the runtime system perform the layout.\n",
    "* Let the UI *react* to changes in the data layer. Change the data and the UI automatically adjusts to the update. This lets us build and test the application/data logic separately from the UI and results in applications that are dramatically easier to build, test, and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a project on [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). Click \"Create Sandbox\" on the landing page. Then\n",
    "select \"React\" from the list of \"Popular Templates\".\n",
    "1. Explore the structure of the project:\n",
    "* `public/index.html` has the main html file for the project. Note in particular the empty `<div id=\"root\"></div>` element in the body of the file. Our app will be loaded into this `div`.\n",
    "* Next, look at `src/index.js`. This is the main Javascript entry point for the app. Line 6 uses `document.getElementById` to find the root `div`. The next line `ReactDOM.render` loads the app into the `div`. (The details of this call are unimportant for now.)\n",
    "* Go to `src/App.js`, which `index.js` imports. This is the code of your app. You'll spend most of you time in this project here. The first thing to notice is that `App` is just a _function_ that returns code that **looks** like HTML. The operative word here is \"looks\". That's not HTML. Instead React uses an extention of Javascript called JSX that lets you embed HTML-like code in Javascript. Those HTML-like elements really just compile to `React.createElement` API calls. Definitely look at the [React JSX Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) to understand this important distinction. Skim the JSX document for now; but you will definitely be coming back for a closer read. Becoming productive in React (that is, graduating from abject frustration) requires an understanding of what JSX is doing behind the scenes.\n",
    "Furthermore, `createElement` isn't manipulating the DOM directly. Instead, it creates a mirror structure called the _Virtual DOM_, which only updates the browser DOM when it must. More on this later. \n",
    "* Notice the declarative structure of the `App` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your First React Component\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to make your first react component. Insert the following into `App.js`, right above the declaration of the `App` component:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const Counter = props => (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        <b>Count:</b> {props.count}\n",
    "    </div>);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll use the `Counter` component in `App` by adding a couple of instances to the main `div` in the `App` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "export default function App() {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div className=\"App\">\n",
    "      <h1>Counter App</h1>\n",
    "      <Counter count={1}/>\n",
    "      <Counter count={2}/>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file. The app will reload automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far the `counters` don't do much. They just show their respective counts, something we'll build upon in the next several steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, there are several things to observe about this simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. React components are just Javascript functions that map arguments (called `props`) to HTML elements or other React components. (React can also be expressed as Javascript classes. But for simplicity and to emphasize the _declarative_ and _functional_ aspects of React, we'll limit our focus to components written as functions.\n",
    "1. These functions are pure. That is, they map from arguments (called `props` in React) to a **tree** of elements that _look_ like HTML markup.\n",
    "1. That markup-like code isn't markup. It's an extension to JavaScript called JSX, which translates elements such as \n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "<MyButton color=\"blue\" shadowSize={2}>\n",
    "  Click Me\n",
    "</MyButton>\n",
    "```\n",
    "to\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "React.createElement(\n",
    "  MyButton,\n",
    "  {color: 'blue', shadowSize: 2},\n",
    "  'Click Me'\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "So `createElement` is just a regular JavaScript function that takes a React component as it's first argument (here, `MyButton`), passes a table of `props` as it's second argument, and a _tree_ of children as it's third. (In the example above, `'Click Me'` is a leaf not a root as is often the case.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the tree of React elements is really a structure React calls a Virtual DOM, a shadow structure which is kept in sync with the real browser DOM. That is, changes to the Virtual DOM are mirrored to the browser. But these changes are batched and applied in an efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please look at the [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) documentation for how to use JSX and for what it's doing under the covers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing State\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now ready to tackle what is the main idea in React: that a UI can be expressed as a  function of state:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "ui = fn(state)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the UI is a function that takes some data (such as a counter or todo list) and returns a rendered user interface. Changes to the data (caused for example by a button click) trigger the function to re-run and re-render the UI. \n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to recognize is that the data (or application state) is completely separate from the UI. This allows us to build the application logic independently from the UI in contrast with the imperative approach above, where UI logic and application logic were interspersed throughout. We'll explore this distinction further by rebuilding the counter in react.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can react tell when data has changed? It utilizes _immutable data structures_. An immutable value is one that does not change once defined. This is in contrast with more conventional _mutable_ structures, which can be changed at will:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let state = {a: 3, b: 4, c: {d: 5, e: 6}}\n",
    "\n",
    "// change b\n",
    "state.b = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "// change d\n",
    "state.c.d = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with mutable structures like the above is that there is no way to tell what changed. For React, mutable data structures make it difficult to determine which part of the application state was updated, and therefore, figure out which parts of the UI to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, immutable structures require the creaction of an entirely new object. React can compare the new and old to compute what changed. Here's a immutable version of the above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const obj = {a: 3, b: 4, c: {d: 5, e: 6}}\n",
    "\n",
    "const newObj = {...obj, b: 10, c: {d: 1}} \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is modern ES6 syntax called [spreading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax). Essentially, `newState` is a _copy_ of `state` with only the fields `state.b` and `state.c.d` having been changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When state changes as above, React compares the mutated copy (e.g., `newState`) with the original (e.g., `state`) to deduce which part of the respective trees changed, which parts of the UI depend on the changes, and finally which parts to re-render.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observant reader will notice that updating immutable object with the copy-and-update approach described above can quite cumbersome, especially in the case of deeply nested structures. Thus, we'll use a popular immutable library called [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction), which lets us update immutable data as if it were mutable. Please read the linked Immer documentation for a more detailed introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build the counter in React. First, you'll need to import `immer` and its helper library `use-immer` into the project. To do this, click on the file explorer icon on the left side bar and then select the \"Dependencies\" tab. Next, press the \"Add Dependency\" button and type \"immer\" followed by \"useimmer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to import immer into `App.js` like so:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import { useImmer } from \"use-immer\";\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now copy the following code for `CounterApp` into `App.js`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const CounterApp = () => {\n",
    "\n",
    "  // useImmer is a function that takes the initial state of the app and returns\n",
    "  // two items: appState and updateAppState\n",
    "  // appState holds the current state of the app (a simple object with a count attribute)\n",
    "  // updateAppState is a function that takes a user-supplied update function as its argument.\n",
    "  const [appState, updateAppState] = useImmer({\n",
    "    count: 0\n",
    "  });\n",
    "\n",
    "  const incrementCounter = () => {\n",
    "    // increment the counter\n",
    "    updateAppState(draft => {\n",
    "      draft.count++;\n",
    "    });\n",
    "  };\n",
    "\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <h2>Counter App</h2>\n",
    "      <div> Count: {appState.count} </div>\n",
    "      <button onClick={incrementCounter}>Increment</button>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to show the `CounterApp`, modify the code for the `App` component:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "export default function App() {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div className=\"App\">\n",
    "      <CounterApp />\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a simple counter app. Click the increment button to see the count increment. Take a few moments to understand the event and data flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At startup, react simply renders the initial state of the app as stored in `appState`.\n",
    "2. The \"Increment\" button has registered a function called `incrementCounter` to handle click events. When you click the button, `incrementCounter` is called.\n",
    "3. `incrementCounter` just calls the immer updater which itself expects a function as its argument. This anonymous arrow function takes a draft of the current state as its single argument. Our anonymous function increments the count and returns. Note that while we appear to be updating the draft in place, immer is really creating an immutable copy of the appState behind the scenes. It uses a clever scheme called copy-on-write to do this.\n",
    "4. Once the `draft` has been updated, replaces the current state with the new state and notifies React. (For more on how this is done, see the React [Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) docs.\n",
    "5. When React detects a new state, it reconciles the updated state with the old and re-renders the app. React uses a variety of optimizations to only re-render into the virtual DOM components that depend on the changed state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above flow is representative of all React apps. To change the UI, mutate the state tree. This forces React to respond by re-rendering the app. Repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your understanding, try your hand at the following two easy extensions to the counter app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Problem 1: Add a Decrement Button\n",
    "Add a Decrement button. Hook it up to a handler that decrements the counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Problem 2: Add a Reset Button\n",
    "Add a Reset button. Connect the button to a handler that resets the app state to some preset value (say '0').\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Problem 3: Compare the Declarative and Imperative Versions\n",
    "Take a minute to admire your handywork. Compare the declarative React app with the imperative version at the top of this page. What are the main differences? How is one better than the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Homework\n",
    "We're now ready to tackle a slightly more complex application, a Todo list. There are literally thousands of versions of this app on github. You'll be tempted to look. Don't!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Todo App will have the following parts:\n",
    "* A form with an text input to enter the title of a task and a submit button to create a task.\n",
    "* Each task will have the following attributes: `id`, `title`, and `completed`\n",
